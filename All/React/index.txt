1)what is reactjs======================
a)ReactJS is open source javascript front-end javascript library
b)it used to build UserInterface application.
c)it is based on component architechture.
d)and main resone of react to develop singlepage applications

2)creating react app======================
The create-react-app is an officially supported way to create React applications.
a)npm install -g create-react-app
b)npx create-react-app myfirstreact
c)cd myfirstreact
d)npm start

3)what is NPM======================
NPM stands for Node Package Manager.used to install third party mouldes and packages 

4)How does React Work? and whate is virtual-DOM======================
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
a)Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory,
 where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
b)React only changes what needs to be changed!
c)React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
d)The vartual DOM is like architechture of tree
e)based on tree it will find fastest root to update
f)vartual DOM very fseter thean original DOM

5)How the react render  HTML elements======================
a)the html web page render by using a function called ReactDOM.render().
b)The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
c)The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
example:
ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root')); 
o/p--The result is displayed in <div id="root"> element:
The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code:

6)what is what is ReactDOM======================
it is a packages provides the specified DOM elements.using this we can render the html code

7)what is JSX======================
a)JSX stands for JavaScript XML, it is a template for reacat application
b)it is allows to write HTML code inside react application
c)it is maks easy to write html code in reacat
d)JSX converts HTML tags into react elements
e)You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
f)when we have mutly line of code in JSX we should write one parant element.otherwise it throw the error

8)what is React component======================
a)a component is block
b)we can reuse the entair component
c)component return the html code through the render() method
d)we have two tyes of component in react 1)functional component 2) class component

9)what is differece between functional & class component ======================
    functional component                                          class component
a)it is simple javascript function                        a)class component we can set the private state 
  another name  call stateless functional                    another name called statful commponent
b)it does't have state                                    b)class component have state
c)it is used for ready & prasentaion purpuss              c)it is used for read & writing any logic purpuss
d)it does have a render() method                          d)it is having render() method
e)functional component only pass props as a  arguments    e)class component we can pass props and set state


10)what is differece between props and state=======    
               props                                                          state
a)communication b/w parant to child component             a)it is a private object 
b)props are arguments which is passed                     b)state we can access with the component
  to the child component
c)prpos are immutable                                     c)state are mutable
d)Props are passed to components like HTML attributes.    d)state is like javascript object
e)props are ready only                                    e) state can changes


10)what is lifeCycle of component======================
a)each componment in react having lifeCycle, which you can monitor and modifying crating application
b)lifeCycle  only in class component 
c) it is happening in three phases
  1.Mounting 2.Updating, 3.Unmounting

1.Mounting Phases**************
when intanstance of a component insterted in to DOM
like mounting is putting element onto the DOM, it is having 4 methods
a)contractor()*******
it is used for initializing state 
and binding method
constractor called with props as argumetns
entair component constractor is executed first   

b)getDerivedStateFromProps*******
before redering componment it is render first
it is having two parameters ,one is state, props

c)render()******
it is used to display the content of application
render is keep updating when we have any chaeges in state

d)commponentDidMount()********
it is mainy used in API's
it is render only one time
it is rendered after componment is rendered

2.Updating Phases**************
a component is updated wherever any  changes in state and props component will updated
it is having 5 methods
a)getDerivedStateFromProps*************
it is first method called when component is updated
it is having two parameters ,one is state, props

b)shouldComponentUpdate()***********
this method will give boolean value whether component rendering or not

c)rendere() **************
it is re-render when component is updated

d)getStanpShortBeforeUpdate()*********
thois method os used access state and props before updating

e)componentDidMount****************
it rendere when component is updated

3.Unmounting Phases**************
when component is removed form the DOM , the react will call Unmounting
it is having only one mehtod 
a)componentUnmounting
b)static getDerivedStateFromError()
c)componentDidCatch()
11)what is events======================
Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events.\
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

12)what is setState======================
a)it is used to changing state in class componentss
b)the commponent state tell to the react this component state and chilren 
 need to be rerendred with the updat state.
c)then with help of setState() it will update the state

13)what is what is Destracturing ======================
a)it is way of accessing multiple proparties and stored in a object and arrys.
b) in react Destracturing improves states and props code redability

14)what is Binding======================
a)Binding is happed with help of this keyword
b)binding is done in the contractor
b)through binding we can achieve the controlled inputs 
c)with help of events we can control rthe state
d)4 ways we ccan bind this.
 1)with help of arrow function
 2)and naming function 
 3)and binding contractor way through the 
 4)we can bind in the events.

15)what is conditional rendering======================
a)it same as javascript looping 
b)it is done specially in terminary operater
c)use of conditional rendering is render only some of them depending on the state of your application

16)what is ListRendering rendering======================
a)it is used when we have multilpl objects like studen details 
b)with help of map method we can do list rendering
example
canst student=["MNC","revanth",20]
let list=studen.map(detsils=> <h1>${detsils}</h1>)

17)what is List and Keys rendering======================
a)above code if you check in console we get one error like each value should be a unique id 
b) so for that we can give see below
example
canst student=["MNC","revanth",20]
let list=studen.map(detsils => <h1 key={id/name}> ${detsils}</h1>)
c)now in the console wiil gone

18)what is List and Index rendering======================
a)it is uesd to give index to the each proparties like 0,1,2,3,4
example
canst student=["MNC","revanth",20]
let list=studen.map((detsils,index) => <h1 key={index}> ${detsils}</h1>)
0 MNC
1 revanth
2 23 like this

19)How can give style in  css======================
we can give style in 3 ways 
a)with help of external file ,like importing the index.css
b)with hepl of {{}} we can give 
ex:  <h1 style={{backgroundColor: "lightblue"}}>Hello Style!</h1>
c)we can give style through object way
example
var myDiv={
      color: "white",
      backgroundColor: "DodgerBlue",
      padding: "10px",
      fontFamily: "Arial"
} 

20)how to handling form ======================
a)we can handling form with help of react events 
b)events are same in Html events like onClick, onSubmit etc

21)what Fragment======================
a)it is used write multiple line of code 
b)like grouping list childrens adding 
C)so here fragment can dose not take memory for child 

22)what is pure component=====================
a)using pure component we can create component by extending PureComponent
b)it implements the shouldComponentUpdate() to performing a comparision state and props
c)it is having only class componment

23)what is memo component=====================
a)it is having in functional componment
b)React. memo is a higher order component.

24)what is refs in react=====================
a) refs it is a function provided by the react
b)using refs we can access the DOM elements 
c)used to where u want change the value of component withoout ussing props


24)what portols component=====================
a)portols are used to write code in outside of the room element
b)for that we should create React.cratesPortels()

25)what is Heigherorder component=====================
a)it is a advanced feature in react 
b)sharing comman functionality to multiple components
c)like one login reusing to multiple components
d)a function takes  argument as function and return the new components
e)if want pass remaing props we should use the spred operator[...this.props] whitout spred operator not work
ex:var comPonen=hierOrderComponent(originalComponet)

26)what is context component=====================
a)it is provides the way to pass data to the componnets tree without having to pass props each component4
b)to do that first crate the context , and provide the context and consume the context
